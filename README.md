### Project Description:

##### This project aims to develop a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image and video data. Using deep learning techniques, the model provides a more intuitive and natural method of human-computer interaction. The system detects user hand gestures in real-time through a camera, offering an effective solution for applications such as assistive technologies for disabled users, gaming, robotic control, and other interactive systems. The project includes both an offline pre-trained CNN model and a real-time prediction component that processes live video streams.

#### Context:
Hand gesture recognition database is presented, composed by a set of near infrared images acquired by the Leap Motion sensor.

#### Content:
The database is composed by 10 different hand-gestures (showed above) that were performed by 10 different subjects (5 men and 5 women).
